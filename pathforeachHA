%This function returns a Tensor T where each element is the hyperarch and
%the first column are the nodes from which the hyperarch starts,and the second
%column is formed by the nodes were the hyperarch enter
%C is a tensor where each element is an hyperarch. The first column of each element specifies 
%if the hyperarch enters, exits or doesn't interact with each node. The
%second column rapresents the weight of the hyperarch.
%A is the incidence matrix
%V is the vector of the weights of each hyperarch
