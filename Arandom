/*This function aim is to generate random matrix composed by a set of 0, 1, -1.
It will take the 10% of the columns of this matrix as sources and another 10% as well; the first n columns would be sources, while the last n columns would be wells.
For each source the corresponding node can only have outgoing hyperarcs, while for each well the corresponding node can only have incoming hyperarcs.
We cannot have nodes that are not sources or wells with only incoming or outgoing hyperarcs.
The function finds the index of the element that are -1 or 1 for each column.
But, if one of them is zero should occur some variation in the code.
The hyperarcs path must go out from some nodes and go into other nodes.
The function finds the index of the element that are -1 or 1 for each column if one of them is zero should occur some variation in the code.*/
